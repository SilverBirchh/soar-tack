# Identify how a solution architecture could be employed to enhance system development or solution delivery in the workplace.

Which do we choose; system development or solution delivery?

## Introduction - What is systems development? What is solution architecture? How Accenture currently does system development. Does it use a system? What kinds of roles are involved? How much granularity is involved; is it formalised?  (650 words)

## What are the strengths and weakness of this current approach? Is there an area where Accenture falls down? (650 words)

## What are the different solution architecture frameworks that could help Accenture? What are the advantages and disadvantages of these frameworks. Do they suit Accenture's needs. Do they need to be adapted in some way? (650 words)

## After deciding on a framework what would be the outcome of employing that type of architecture. Short/medium/long term? What would be the specific advantages to Accenture? (650 words)

## Conclusion. Why is a solution architecture framework important? Quickly bring together what it would do for Accenture. (400 words)

List and outline Zachman, TOGAF, FEA. What they aim to do and how they achieve it. 

What are the advantages of these frameworks? What are the disadvantages? Do this by explaining what makes a good framework. Then this can be broken down in to tables: Cost/Benefit Analysis
¥	Often difficult to work out the “real” costs and benefits
¥	An assessment of the costs and the benefits of a course of action and/or a proposed system.
Risk Analysis
¥	What can go wrong?
¥	Analysis of vulnerabilities that threaten the ability of a target system to meet requirements, especially non-functional requirements, including security. Risk analysis is needed before architecture definition starts in earnest, and then several times later in the process, and at several levels of design.
Gap Analysis
¥	What have we got, and what haven’t we got?
¥	Generally, a technique for comparing two similar lists or structures, to find potentially missing items. It can be used to compare two optional solutions, and identify gaps in one or both.
¥	It helps if the two options are presented under the same structure as each
¥	other, or a more general structure.
Trade-off Analysis
¥	If all else is equal, which one?
¥	A process in which a consultant leads analysis of target system options and the trade offs between them. Published and promoted by the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie Mellon University
A common Cost/Benefit Analysis technique is:
Return on Investment
¥	What do we get out of it?
¥	A statement of benefits gained minus costs spent.
¥	Costs must cover development, implementation, operation and maintenance.
¥	Benefits may include money made, money saved, regulations complied and the resolution of specific problems. E.g. The benefit of data integrity reflect is save the cost of data dis-integrity.

Explain what is unique about Accenture? How will each type of architecture need to be moulded to meet Accenture’s specific needs?
